I found the address of auth, the original return address from the check_password
function and the start address of libc.

I found the address of the following commands:

mov eax, -1; 
inc eax; inc eax;  (So, now eax is 1)
pop edx (I puted the address of auth in the next instruction after this pop, so edx is now this address)
mov [edx], eax;
